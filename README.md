# Grayscale Image Tutorial

Extract pixel intensity information from a grayscale plant image of tobacco. 

It is a good idea to capture a test image and process it using PlantCV (or any other software that you might use) before capturing a full set of data. It is ALWAYS best to try to reduce potential image processing problems up front, rather than to try to process 'bad' / inconsistent images.
